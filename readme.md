# Introduction to Python and Programming in Python

Python is one of the most widely used and highly valued programming languages
in the world, and is especially widely used in data science, machine learning,
and in other scientific computing applications.  In order to use Python
confidently and competently for these applications, it is necessary to have a
solid foundation in the fundamentals of general purpose Python.  This two day
course provides a general introduction to the Python environment, the Python
language, and general purpose programming in Python.  We cover how to install
and set up a Python computing environment, describing how to set virtual
environments, how to use Python package installers, and overview some Python
integrated development environments (IDE) and Python Jupyter notebooks.  We then
provide a comprehensive introduction to programming in Python, covering all the
following major topics: data types and data container types, conditionals,
iterations, functional programming, object oriented programming, modules,
packages, and imports.  Note that in this course, we will not be covering
numerical and scientific programming in Python directly. That is provided in a
subsequent two-day course, for which the topics covered in this course are a
necessary prerequisite.

## Intended Audience

This course is aimed at anyone who is interested in learning the fundamentals
of Python generally and especially for ultimately using Python for data science
and scientific applications. Although these applications are not covered
directly here, but are covered in a subsequent course, the fundamentals taught
here are vital for master data science and scientific applications of Python.

## Teaching Format

This course will be hands-on and workshop based. Throughout each day, there
will be some brief introductory remarks for each new topic, introducing and
explaining key concepts.

The course will take place online using Zoom. On each day, the live video broadcasts will occur between (UK local time) at:

* 10am-12pm
* 1pm-3pm
* 4pm-6pm

All the sessions will be video recorded, and made available immediately on a private video hosting website. Any materials, such as slides, data sets, etc., will be shared via GitHub.

## Assumed quantitative knowledge

No particular knowledge of mathematics or statistics is required.

## Assumed computer background

No prior experience with Python or any other programming language is required.
Of course, any familiarity with any other programming will be helpful, but is not
required.  

## Equipment and software requirements

Attendees of the course must use a computer with Python (version 3) installed.
This can in fact be done entirely online for free using Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) without needing to install any software on your own laptop or desktop.
If you are new to Python, this approach is *highly* recommended. You will be able to immediately starting learning Python without any installation or configuration of software.
This entire course can be done using this approach.

If you prefer to install and use Python on your machine, instructions on how to install and configure all the software needed for this course are [provided here](software.md).
We will also provide time during the workshops to ensure that all software is installed and configured properly.

# Course programme

## Day 1

* Topic 1: *Installing and setting up Python*. There are many ways to write and
  execute code in Python. Which to use depends on personal preference and the
  type of programming that is being done.  Here, we will explore some of the
  commonly used Integrated Development Environments (IDE) for Python, which
  include *Spyder* and *PyCharm*. Here, we will also introduce
  `Jupyter` notebooks, which are widely used for scientific applications of
  Python, and are an excellent tool for doing reproducible interactive work. Also as part of this
  topic, we will describe how to use *virtual environments* and package
  installers such as *pip* and *conda*.

* Topic 2: *Data Structures*. We will begin our
  coverage of programming with Python by introducing its different data
  structures.and operations on data structures This will begin with the
  elementary data types such as integers, floats, Booleans, and strings,
  and the common operations that can be applied to these data types.
  We will then proceed to the so-called *collection* data structures,
  which primarily include lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.

* Topic 3: *Programming I*. Having introduced Python's data types, we will now
  turn to how to program in Python. We will begin with iteration, such as the
`for` and `while` loops. Here, we also cover some of Python's functional
programming features, specifically list, dictionary, and set comprehensions.

## Day 2

* Topic 4: *Programming II*. Having covered iterations, we now turn to other
  major programming features in Python, specifically, conditionals,
functions, and exceptions.

* Topic 5: *Object Oriented Programming*. Python is an object oriented language
  and object oriented programming in Python is extensively used in anything
  beyond the very simplest types of programs. Moreover, compared to other
  languages, object oriented programming in Python is relatively easy to learn.
  Here, we provide a comprehensive introduction to object oriented programming
  in Python.

* Topic 6: *Modules, packages, and imports*. Python is extended by hundreds of
  thousands of additional packages. Here, we will cover how to install and
import these packages, but more importantly, we will show how to write our own
modules and packages, which is remarkably easy in Python relative to some
programming languages.
